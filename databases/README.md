# Smotif Databases
DINGO-PCS requires access to Smotif databases. </br>
Three non-redundant Smotif databases at different cutoffs are available for download.
 1. (0.07 Å cutoff) http://comp-bio.anu.edu.au/huber/Smotifs/database_cutoff_0.07.tar.gz
 2. (0.1 Å cutoff)  http://comp-bio.anu.edu.au/huber/Smotifs/database_cutoff_0.1.tar.gz
 3. (0.25 Å cutoff) http://comp-bio.anu.edu.au/huber/Smotifs/database_cutoff_0.25.tar.gz

Which one to download? </br>
Depends on how fast or how exhaustive you need to sample.
 - On super computers, use the 0.07 Å cutoff database.
 - On workstations,  use the 0.25 Å cutoff database.
